## MultiNet Toolkit Dashboard User Workflow

Pull data from Web of Science (WoS).

Interaction with the dashboard is facilitated through the Metrics tab.

Under Networks, select the network for analysis.

Type local file path into text box in the top right of the dashboard, and load via 'Get data' button.

Be patient, the network may take a few moments to parse. A visualization as well as a table displaying the edgelist will populate.

To change network analysis, toggle back and forth between co-authorship, and co-citation buttons.

Color clustering is available for Girvan-Newman and K-core subsets.

Use the Centralities dropdown to observe betweenness, weighted degree, and closeness centralities. The top 10 actors will be generated in the table at the bottom of the page.

All tables are available for export. Click the export button and for a CSV download of the chosen analysis.
